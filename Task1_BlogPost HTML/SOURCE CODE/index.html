      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Web development has become one of the most exciting fields in the tech world today. It blends creativity with problem-solving, allowing you to build websites, apps, and entire platforms from scratch. My journey into this world started with a curiosity to know how websites work behind the scenes.</p>
  
  <p>At first, terms like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sounded technical and overwhelming. But with some guidance, I learned that HTML is simply the structure—the skeleton—of every webpage. Just like building a house starts with a frame, web development starts with HTML.</p>
  
  <p>This blog post marks the beginning of my web development journey. I'm sharing my learnings here not just to document them, but to inspire others who are just getting started like me. Whether you're a complete beginner or just revisiting the basics, this post will walk you through the essential building blocks of HTML.</p>

      <h2>Main Content</h2>
      <p>Here’s what I’ve learned so far:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language</li>
        <li>HTML uses semantic tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;</li>
        <li>Each page starts with a doctype declaration</li>
        <li>Structure matters more than style in HTML</li>
        <li>Images and links can enrich your content</li>
      </ul>
